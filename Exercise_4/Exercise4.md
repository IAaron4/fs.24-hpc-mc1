### Part 4: Performance Analysis and Evaluation of your Application

Profile your producers and consumers/data sinks. Describe the patterns and bottlenecks you see while executing different scenarios and workloads. Perform 2-3 experiments with different configurations.

  Some example experiments:
  
  * Measure the average time incl. standard deviation required by your producer/consumer loop over several runs.
  * Determine which call of your producer/consumer takes the most time. Which 3 methods are called the most or need the most time and how much time?
  * Create a profile of your producer/consumer code in a xxxxx.prof file and create 1-2 visualizations of the profile (e.g. with [SnakeViz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/)) to which you explain in the context of the profiling work.

#### Bonus 4
Mitigate or produce a bottleneck.


## Reflection

Write a reflection on the realization of the mini-challenge. What went well? Where did problems occur? Where did you need more time than planned? 
What would you do differently in the future? What would you change in the assignment? Give examples in each case.
