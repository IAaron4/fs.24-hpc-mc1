### Part 2: Performance Analysis and Evaluation of Kafka

In this part you will adjust the application you developed in part 1. In the following list you find a multitude of "Deep Dives" where you use advanced Kafka topics. Use at least two of them and apply those on your application.   

* Consumer Groups
* Find out the limits of send/receive of your application (and of Kafka in general)
* Distribution of brokers and partitions
* Replication factors and partition counts
* Offset/Reprocessing
* Retention/Compaction
* Kafka Streams
* Retries
* How does a key have to look like?

Perform different experiments with your chosen DeepDives with different configurations/scenarios and describe the results. Conclude with effective use cases for those features in case your own application is not really a use case for them.

#### Bonus 2
Make more than 2 DeepDives.
