### Part 3: Communication Patterns

1. Rewrite your application of part 1 using another communication framework such as RabbitMQ and/or another underlying messaging protocol such as ZeroMQ or MQTT.
    
2. Pack your rewritten application into containers.

3. Answer the following questions and interpret your experiments or results: 
      * Compare the communication patterns of Kafka and your chosen technology. Where are they similar, where different? How do those patterns work? Are there advantages or disadvantages of those patterns? 
      * Are there any known issues with those patterns? If yes, how could those issues be mitigated or on the other hand provoked? If possible, show this with an experiment.
      * How scalable are those two approaches? What challenges need to be considered? 

#### Bonus 3
Show how your container setup could be integrated into a container orchestration system (such as Kubernets) and how it would profit from this. Or show how you could replace some of the components with cloud-based offers and what changes/considerations come with this.
